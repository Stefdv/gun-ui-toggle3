 Background
 ===
I discovered Gun in the beginning of 2016 while searching for an offline firebase alternative. At that time i developed e-learning applications that would be used on an <i>intra</i>net structure without <i>inter</i>net access.<br>So i started to learn the Gun Api and thanks to the creator of Gun (Mark Nadal) - who is extremely helpfull - i begun to understand the potential of Gun.

I never used Gun in any e-learning applications because i changed jobs in the mean time...but i never stopped discovering Gun.<br>Because of that i started to see new oppurtunities to use Gun...a big project...a probably complex project.

Gun is in constant development, the API changed a lot over time and - while developing my project - i spend hours to rewrite my code to keep up with the API changes, but also because i kept discovering new possibilities....<br>This had to stop...i want to develop frontend, not going through lines of code over and over again.</p>

Webcomponents...why?
===
Being a frontend developer i like to build my applications with blocks...divs, sections , articles and stuff. Webcomponents give me just that...custom building blocks...I only have to create them once. And i have to make them work with Gun.<br>
So i did...
